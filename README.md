# Tic-Tac-Toe-game-for-beginner
The game starts with player 1 choosing the marker. Player 1 and player 2 then gets consecutive chances to place their markers on the positions of their choices on the board (having 9 empty places at the start of the game). As soon as any player wins the game with his marker placed in any straight line on the board, the game can be replayed (if the player chooses to do so).  
Note1: Choice of marker (X/O) is provided to 'player 1' and 'player 2' gets the other marker by default.
Note2: Choice of positions is provided to both the players
